# SecureSnow
A more general implementation of my rust security analytics project + perhaps some runtime trace analytics. 



Left Field Sourcing to think about incorporatings
   - Ontological Engineering Data Traces 
      - (Rebinding/RetroBinding to Semantic Structural Implications)
      - Structural Binding to Data Trace Implications
      - Opportunities to identify alignment anomalies between data and structure as potential nefarious modifications?
   - Lambda Calc for doing parametric-balancing to bind an intermediate for normalization of runtime models?
      - For a higher level arch that gets us out of dealing with exact machine and lang-runtime systems 
        at a modeling statement perspective?
